This project is a simple simulation of database website using ReactJS. The main scope was to get the certain data from the database API depending on user's selected options. The responsiveness of the website was not taken into consideration.

These are the features that I was focused on:

1) Show data from database API depending on selected options.
2) Filter the data.
3) Sort the data.
4) Search items.
5) Add items to the favourites.
6) Login / Sign in.
7) Show different information and features depending on whether the user is logged in or not.
